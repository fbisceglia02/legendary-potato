# legendary-potato
Legendary-Potato is my personal repository where I follow YouTube tutorials to learn the Vue.js framework. It's a centralized hub for all my code, resources, and notes related to my Vue.js learning journey. I organize the repository into different folders based on the tutorial topics and stages of my learning. It helps me track my progress, review concepts, and refer back to specific tutorials or code snippets whenever I need them. It's a valuable resource that allows me to document and keep a history of my growth as I explore Vue.js. üï∂Ô∏è
